# ClusterAnalysis

This is an R script that was written to take random sub-samples of a gene list and determined if the genes within that list are clustered together more often than we would expect by chance. 

This program requires CROC.pl (https://github.com/emepyc/croc) and a list of genes expressed in your tissue of interest or the genome of interest.
